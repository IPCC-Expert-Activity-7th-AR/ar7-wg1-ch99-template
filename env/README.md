# Environment Folder README

The `env/` folder contains environment specification files and documentation necessary to **recreate the software environment** used in this project. This ensures that analyses and figures can be reproduced reliably across different systems.

Add the relevant configuration files to this folder when setting up or documenting the project environment.

Recommended configuration files include, but are not limited to:

- **Python:** `environment.yml`, `requirements.txt`
- **R:** `install.R`, `DESCRIPTION`, `renv.lock`
- **Makefile:** Optional automation for environment setup, package installation, or other routine tasks.
- **Other tools:** Any additional configuration files required for reproducible builds

For an overview of commonly supported configuration files for reproducible builds, see the [repo2docker documentation](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#config-files).
